  - Token passed to each node enables talking on network.
  - MAN's, WAN's use them.
    - dual-rings, built-in fault tolerance.
      - If line is severed, the two devices on each side of sever will 'see' it and send communication back the other direction till it reaches destination.
- **Hybrid**
  - more than one topology combined together.
- **Network types and characteristics**
  - **Peer-to-peer (P2P)**
    - two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a separate server.

    - **geosynchronous**: high orbit, higher latency, less satellites (22,000 miles).
      - latency 250ms each way. slow due to latency (distance from dish to satellite). Expensive.
      - This is an issue for real-time applications, such as videoconferencing, VoIP, and multiplayer gaming.
  - **Digital subscriber line (DSL)**

- **Bidirectional wavelength division multiplexing (BiDi WDM)**
  - BiDi. bi-directional communication on same strand of fiber. full duplex.
  - BiDi transceivers must be installed in opposite pairs, so one end of fiber the transceiver would use 1490 nm to Tx(transmit), the other end transceiver will use 1490nm to Rx(receive).
  - sends different wavelengths of light(different colors).
  - **Coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM)**

- **Public vs. private**
  - **RFC1918**
    - IANA(internet assinged numbers authority) provides address blocks to RIR (Regional Internet Registries).
    - RIR assigns smaller blocks to ISP(internet service providers).
  - Public
    - routable over the internet. assigned by ISP.
  - Private addresses are defined in **RFC 1918** and sometimes referred to as RFC 1918 address space.
    - RFC 1918 - Private Address are not routable on the public internet.
    - any organization can use private routing without asking permission.
    - 10.x.x.x/8
    - 172.16.x.x/12 (172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x)
    - 192.168.x.x/16
    - 169.254.x.x/16 (APIPA). First 256 and last 256 address are reserved.
  - **Network address translation (NAT)**
    - NAT is 1:1 mapping between private IPv4 and public IPv4 addresses.
    - NAT is configured on a border device, such as a router, proxy server, or firewall.
  - **Port address translation (PAT)**
    - map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address by using different port numbers.
    - PAT is configured on a border device, such as a router, proxy server, or firewall.
- **IPv4 vs. IPv6**
  - **Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)**
    - if DHCP server not found, OS will assign itself an IP. (169.254.1.0-169.254.254.255)
    - first and last 256 address reserved by IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force).
    - can only communicate on local network.
    - computer sends ARP, if no response, computer picks that APIPA IP.
  - **Extended unique identifier (EUI-64)**
    - converts 48bit MAC address into 64bit EUI-64. This method is automatically configure IPv6 host addresses.
      1. MAC address(48bit).
      2. first 24 bits: OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier). Split here.
      3. `FFFE` are added to middle of MAC(after first 24 bits).
      4. last 24 bits: NIC (Network Interface Card). Added after `FFFE`.
      5. First byte of MAC is converted to binary, 7 bit is flipped.
         1. MAC: `00:60:8C:12:3A:BC` = EUI-64: `0260:8CFF:FE12:3ABC`
         2. This becomes link-local address: `FE80::0260:8CFF:FE12:3ABC`
         3. `FE80::`(64bit) is prefix for link-local.
  - **Multicast**
    - IPv4 and IPv6 only devices must subscribe.
    - IPv4 has reserved thew class D **224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255** addresses as a multicast range.
  - **Unicast**
    - one-to-one. one device to another.
  - **Anycast**
    - assigning same ip to multiple servers or network nodes in different geographic locations. These servers provide the same service.
    - packets delivered to closest interface. DNS, CDN servers are setup this way.
  - **Broadcast**
    - one-to-all. broadcast domain. does not leave router. ARP request.
  - **Link local**
    - IPv4 sometimes called link local, but is APIPA. private ip address self assigned when DHCP server not found.
    - IPv6 creates it's own private IP(link local) using SLAAC.
  - **Loopback**
    - 127.0.0.1-127.255.255.254
  - **Default gateway**
    - IPv4 protocol compares the source and destination address in each packet against the netmask(255.255.255.0).
    - If masked portion does not match, packet must be routed to another network through the 'default gateway'.
- **IPv4 subnetting**
  - **Classless (variable-length subnet mask)**
    - solved the Class-based network. allows subnetting.
    - allows network administrators to break down an IP address space into subnets of various sizes.

  - E: reserved address. 240-255
- **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation**
  - CIDR was introduced 1993 to slow the usage of IPv4 address exhausting.
  - CIDR addresses use variable length subnet masking (VLSM) to alter the ratio between the network and host address bits in an IP address.
- **IPv6 concepts**
  - 128 bit address. 16 bits as hex, in 8 groups.
  - **Tunneling**
    - 6to4. tunnel IPv6 over the IPv4 network.
    - 4to6. tunnel IPv4 over the IPv6 network. GRE(Generic Routing Encapsulation) protocol.
  - **Dual stack**
    - device can use IPv4 and IPv6. Each protocol has separate routing table.
  - **Shorthand notation**
    - group of zeros: '::' // can only be one double colon.
    - leading zeros optional.
  - **Router advertisement**
    - Client sends RS (router solicitation) and Router responds with RA (router advertisement). sent out as multicast.
    - router can also send unsolicited RA.
  - **Neighbor Solicitation (NS)**
    - no broadcast in IPv6. NS sends multicast. All IPv6 devices will answer back NA (neighbor advertisement) with there MAC address.
  - **Stateless address auto configuration (SLAAC)**: host automatically assigns itself a IPv6 link-local address and solicits routing and subnet information from network router.
    1. `FE80::` + `EUI-64` (Extended Unique Identifier) becomes the 128 bit link-local address.
    2. Once link local IP address is known, host sends out an **DAD (duplicate address detection)** as ICMPv6 via Network Discovery Protocol – Network Solicitation (NDP NS). makes sure no duplicate ip on network.
    3. After IPv6 link-local is confirmed as unique. RS(Router solicitation) is sent out asking for router to announce itself with a RA(Router Advertisement).
    4. The RA will include the Global routable prefix. The device will take `first global 64bit + EUI-64` for global address.
    5. This process does not provide DNS server IP. DHCPv6 is used for this.
- **Virtual IP (VIP)**
  - logical ip address assigned to virtual machines.
  - router use this for redundancy, high availability, and fault tolerant.
    - Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).
- **Subinterfaces**
  - virtual link between VLAN's.
  - Each subinterface is configured with a specific VLAN ID.
  - VLAN traffic is routed from one VLAN subinterface to the destination VLAN subinterface.
  - Layer 3 switches are optimized for VLAN routing.

- **IP protocol types**
  - **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**
    - another protocol of IP. not used for data transfer. request/reply, send messages.
    - report errors and send messages about the delivery of a packet.
    - ICMP messages are generated under error conditions in most types of unicast traffic, but not for broadcast or multicast packets.
  - **TCP**
    - Transmission Control Protocol. Transport layer 4 to provide connection-oriented, guaranteed communication using acknowledgements to ensure that delivery has occurred.
    - allows mutiplexing(many applications at same time), flow control.
  - **UDP**
    - User Datagram Protocol. connectionless, non-guaranteed method of communication
    - no acknowledgments or flow control.
  - **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**
    - encapsulate and route any layer 2 or 3 packet. No encryption.
  - **Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)**
    - open standard. symmetric key. popular with VPN's. encrypts layer 3 payload.
    - secure IPv4 and/or IPv6 communications on local networks and as a remote access protocol.
    - Each host that uses IPSec must be assigned a policy. only peers that can authenticate with each other can connect.
    - ensures: confidentiality(encrypted), integrity(hash checking for modified in transit), and authenticity(identity is established by peers).
    - An **IPSec policy** sets the authentication mechanism and also the protocols and mode for the connection.
      1. Two peers prove identity(authenticity) by using certificates or pre-shared keys.
      2. **IKE Phase 1**: asymmetric key exchange(Diffie-Hellman). slow. both side will have the same DH key. will be kept.
      3. **IKE Phase 2**: agree encryption methods. use DH to creates the symmetric key. fast. can be torn down and re-established quickly.
    - **Policy Based VPN**: rule sets match traffic that should use vpn tunnel.
      - can have multiple tunnel security methods for each type of interesting traffic match.
    - **Route Based VPN**: target match on prefix. (192.168.0.0/24 -> VPN). single tunnel all traffic flows.
    - **AH (Authentication Header)**: performs hash on packet. provides integrity, no encryption. not popular.
      - adds hash to the AH(integrity check value). both sender receiver hash must match.
    - **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)**: confidentiality, integrity, authentication. Most Common.
      - encrypts entire layer 3 packet. adds IP Header, Payload(encrypted data), Trailer, ICV.
      - **Transport Mode**: does not encrypt header.
      - **Tunnel Mode**: encrypts header.
- **Connectionless vs. connection-oriented**
  - Two ways to send data: Connection-Oriented and Connectionless Service.
  - **Connection-oriented**: TCP. service involves the creation and termination of the connection for sending the data between two or more devices.
  - **connectionless**: UDP. service does not require establishing any connection and termination process for transferring the data over a network.

%

- **DHCP**
  - automates the assigning: ip, subnet mask, gateway, dns, ntp...
  - **mnemonic: DORA: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge**.
  - **DHCP Discover**: new device sends 0.0.0.0:68(udp) to 255.255.255.255:67(udp) -all nodes gets broadcast message.
  - **DHCP Offer**: DHCP responds will this address work?: 10.10.10.99:67(udp) to 255.255.255.255:68(udp) -all nodes.
  - **DHCP Request**: new client responds look good: 0.0.0.0:68(udp) to 255.255.255.255:67(udp) -all nodes
  - **DHCP Acknowledgement**: DHCP says ok: 10.10.10.99:67(udp) to 255.255.255.255:68(udp) -all nodes
  - **Scope**: configure DHCP server with options.
    - **Exclusion ranges**: do not assign these addresses.
    - **Reservation**: same as static assignment, but also assigns DNS, Default gateway...
    - **Dynamic assignment**: DHCP chooses IP from pool.
    - **Static assignment**: MAC of new device and IP is added to DHCP server. network admin manually configure.
    - **Lease time**: time till ip address renewal.
      - T1 timer: 50% of lease time, renew.
      - T2 timer: 87.5% of lease time, look for another DHCP server.
    - **Scope options**: dns, ip range(pool), excluded ip address, lease duration, default gateway.
    - **Available leases**: IP address pool.
  - **DHCP relay**: enterprise. access to dhcp server outside broadcast domain.
    - new devices ask broadcast DHCP Discover. Router knows no DHCP server on network, so relays to next subnet.
  - **IP helper/UDP forwarding**:
    - cisco command to setup router DHCP relay.
    - udp forwarding: generic setup on router to forward DHCP, and Network Time Protocol (NTP) and other broadcast-based applications.
- **DNS**
  - translate domain name into ip address.
  - **Record types**
    - **Address (A vs. AAAA)**: maps FQDN(`www.example.com`) to IPv4(A) and IPv6(AAAA) address.
    - **Canonical name (CNAME)**: redirect from one FQDN to another. alias.
    - **Mail exchange (MX)**: email server FQDN(`mail.example.com`) and ip address.

  - **Internal vs. external**: loScation of DNS. local network or external network.
  - **Zone transfers**: secondary DNS for redundancy.
    - **DNS Primary Zone**: primary name server. dns record can be edited.
    - **DNS Secondary Zone**: secondary name server. zone transfer caches original and is read-only dns record.
  - **Authoritative name servers**: DNS response came from DNS authority, not cached.
  - **Time to live (TTL)**: how long cached Domain name is valid.
  - **DNS caching**: local copy of DNS response.
  - **Reverse DNS/reverse lookup/forward lookup**
    - forward: query dns with FQDN, DNS provides IP address.
    - reverse: query dns with IP address, DNS provides FQDN.
  - **Recursive lookup/iterative lookup**
    - Recursive: DNS server does the lookup.
    - Iterative: client keep asking different Name Servers till DNS Authority sever is found.
- **NTP**

%

- **Three-tiered**
  - ![three tier](./img/cisco_three_tier_hierarchy.PNG)
  - **core layer**: network backbone. layer 3 switches. redundant traffic to network. full mesh with distribution layer 3 switches.
  - **distribution/aggregation layer**: redundant layer 3 switches. full or partial mesh link to each layer 3 switch.
    - implement traffic policies, such as routing boundaries, filtering, or quality of service (QoS).
  - **access/edge layer**: allow connection to network. layer 2 switches.
- **Software-defined networking**
  - ![software defined network](./img/sdn.PNG)
  - enables intelligent network control from central location to be controlled using software.
  - virtualize physical network. Automation and Orchestration.
  - **These 3 layers allow the network to be decoupled from the hardware**:
    - **Application Layer**: focus on the communication resources of the network.
    - **Control Layer**: the how to route,prioritize,forward data packets on network.
    - **Infrastructure Layer**:
  - **Application layer**: business logic. how traffic prioritized(QoS), secured. Segmentation, ACL, traffic shaping.
    - **Northbound API**:
  - **Control layer**: SDN controller implements control layer. exposes API for scripting. every physical device must be able to communicate by an API.
    - **Southbound API**:
    - **Control Plane/Management Plane**: in the control layer. for monitoring. cpu,memory/traffic,network.
  - **Infrastructure layer**: network devices that receive information about where to move packets from the API.
- **Spine and leaf**
  - ![spine leaf design](./img/spine-and-leaf-architecture.jpg)
  - Typically found in data centers. Designed to address the increasing demands for bandwidth, low latency, add redundancy.
  - Most traffic is **East/West**. When data in data centers is spread across multiple servers. Helps them communicate more efficiently.
  - good scalability. single hop to backbone.
  - each leaf has redundant paths. load balancing and failover. Equal Cost Multipathing.
  - does not need STP. spine switches do not connect to each other. leaf switches do not connect to each other.
  - servers are connected to multiple leaf switches. redundancy. first hop gateway determines path.
  - **spine**: backbone. each switch connects to all leaf switches(full mesh).
  - **leaf**: no direct connection to one another. top tier leaf switches(**top-of-rack (ToR)**)
  - **ToR**: top-of-rack switches have 10 Gbps access ports and 40/100 Gbps uplink ports.
- **Traffic flows**
  - **North-South**: traffic leaving/entering network.
  - **East-West**: - **East-West**: traffic stays within the datacenter. Security concerns for traffic that increases the zero trust(servers must auth to talk.)
- **Branch office vs. on-premises datacenter vs. colocation**
  - Branch office: remote location. Hub and spoke topology.
  - on-premises: in-house
  - colocation: share data center with others.
- **Storage area networks**
  - block level access. feels like local harddrive. efficient reading/writing. requires lot of bandwidth.
  - dedicated special adapters, cables, switches, NICs. Has own protocol, not Ethernet protocol.
  - Sends SCSI(scuzzy -the same command pc send harddrive) commands over FC network.
  - **HBA Host Bus Adapter**: equivalent of NIC. Not ethernet, so frame is different. HBA on storage server and server.
  - **WWN World Wide Name**: 8 byte address.`15:00:00:F0:8C:08:95:DE`. Similar to MAC address, but 64bit.
  - **WWNN World wide Node Name**: assigned to a node in the Storage network. one node can have multiple HBA's, but WWNN signifies the node.
  - **WWPN World Wide Port Name**: identifies each HBA on a node. Similar to MAC. assigned to both storage node and server.
  - **Connection types**:
    - **Initiator**: client device asking for data.
    - **Target**: network port of storage device.
      - initiators and targets are identified by 64-bit WorldWide Names (WWN).
    - **FC Switch**: interconnections between initiators and targets.
      - multiple paths between initiators and targets, allow for fault tolerance and load balancing.
      - High performance FC switches are often referred to as **directors**.
  - **Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)**:
    - delivering Fibre Channel packets over Ethernet cabling and switches.
    - requires special 10/40/100G adapters that combine the function of NIC and HBA, referred to as converged network adapters (CNAs).
    - FCoE uses a special frame type, identified by the EtherType value 0x8096. The protocol maps WWNs onto MAC addresses.
  - **Fibre Channel**:
    - high speed network to SAN. SCSI communication.
    - Storage device and Server need HBA in place of NIC and special FC switches.
  - **Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)**:
    - IP tunneling protocol that enables the transfer of SCSI data over an IP-based(Ehternet) network.

  - If security breach, client will still be responsible for stolen data.
  - potentially confidential or commercially secret data may be transferred over links that extend beyond the enterprise’s infrastructure and direct control.
  - service level agreement (SLA) as a cloud responsibility matrix should identify precisely which risks you are transferring; to identify which responsibilities the service provider is undertaking.
  - legal implications of using a cloud provider if its servers are in a different country.
  - insider threat, where the insiders are administrators working for the service provider.
  - data is in proximity to other, unknown virtual servers and that some sort of attack could be launched on your data from another virtual server.

- **Routing**
  - **Dynamic routing protocols**
    - ![dynamic protocols](./img/dynamic_routing_protocols_overview.PNG)
    - algorithm and metrics to build and maintain a routing information database(route table).
    - routers use dynamic routing protols to add learned routes to their routing table.
    - **Routing Internet Protocol (RIP)**: distance vector(hop count). Max size 15 hops. known as 'routing by rumor'.
      - v1: classful(port UDP:520), v2: classless(port UDP:520), RIPng: IPv6(port UDP:521).
      - sends entire database to neighbor every 30 seconds.
      - When a router receives an update from a neighbor, it adds unknown routes to its own routing table.
    - **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**: link-state.
      - hierarchical(routers are grouped into OSPF areas).
        - **Area border routers**: connect the different areas.
        - ABRs: autonomous system border router. connects to internet. ABR's elect backbone(Area 0).
      - LSA: each entry in database(LSDB).
      - LSDB: complete database of topology.
    - **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)**: cisco. distance vector/hybrid(hops + bandwidth + delay).
    - **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**: Path Vector. uses EGP. network connects to any external network (ISP, Internet).
  - **Link state vs. distance vector vs. hybrid**:
    - **link state**: router knows the state of every link(interface) on every router. considers bandwidth(speed) of link(cost). scalable.
    - **distance vector**: best route based on hops. only knows direct neighbor. doesn't scale. doesn't factor speed of connection.
    - **hybrid**: combine hops and link speed. EIGP and BGP(border gateway protocol).
  - **Static routing**: route table is updated manually.
  - **Default route**:
    - if packet does not match route in routing table, send to this ip. 0.0.0.0/0
    - prevents router from dropping packet when IP is not in routing table.
  - **Administrative distance**: trustworthiness(best) of the protocol.
    - metric value given to each routing protocol(rip, ospf...). lower number better.
    - longest prefix match: most specific ip match to route. If more than one route with identical prefix match, use least-cost path(metric).

| Route Source           | Default AD |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Direct Connected Route | 0          |
| Static Route           | 1          |

  - Interior: Routing within an AS. Tuned for speed and responsiveness.
- **Time to live**: layer 3. reduced by one each hop. at zero, packet is discarded.
- **Bandwidth management**
  - improve the overall network performance, reduce latency, and provide a better user experience.
  - **Traffic shaping**: delay based on content. store lower priority packets till network idle.
  - **Quality of service (QoS)**: priority over other packets(VoIP, video). marked in the packet header.
    - **Management Plane**: monitor traffic conditions.
    - **Control Plane**: decisions about traffic priority and where it should be switched.

  - **Router Advertisement (RA) Guard**: drops unauthorized IPV6 Neighbor Discovery and RA traffic. similar to DHCP snooping.
  - **Port security**: Port-Based Network Access Control(PNAC): switch performs some sort of authentication of the attached device before activating the port.
  - **Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI)**: prevents a host from flooding gratuitous ARP replies.
  - **Control Plane Policing**: attacker spoofs high-priority traffic(QoS). creates high demands on routers/switches. DoS.
    - normal traffic uses ASIC chips to process frames without needing much overhead.
    - QoS uses processing and memory(Control and Management planes) to route.
  - **Private VLANs (PVLAN)**: restricting the ability of hosts within a VLAN to communicate directly with one another.
    - Promiscuous Port: can communicate with every vlan.
    - Isolated Port: can only communicate with promiscuous port.
    - Community Port: only in same community and promiscuous.
  - **Disable unneeded switchports**: prevent gaining access to network. 802.1X(EAP,RADIUS).
  - **Disable unneeded network services**: every service on network needs an open port. close all ports except required ports.
    - control with next generation firewall(NGFW). remove any unknown services.
    - scan for open ports with nmap.
  - **Change default passwords**: default passwords are well known.
  - **Password complexity/length**: increase entropy. uppper/lower/special chars. 14 chars or more.
  - **Enable DHCP snooping**: drops unauthorized DHCP packets.
  - **Change default VLAN**: VLAN 1. no ports should be assigned to default vlan.
    - Native Vlan: untagged traffic(legacy no 802.1Q) on trunk is routed here. Change to non-default vlan on all switches.
  - **Patch and firmware management**: monitor and update security patches. always have a rollback plan.
  - **Access control list**: allow/deny traffic based on tuples(grouping of categories: source ip, dest ip, port).
  - **Role-based access**: least privilege. assign role to employee, roles come preconfigured with necessary access.
  - **Firewall rules**: allow/deny traffic. firewall will log any rule match. adding explicit deny: any | deny, will log all traffic denied.
    - **Explicit deny**: match rule, deny.
    - **Implicit deny**: no matches rule, drop.
- **Wireless security**:
  - **MAC filtering**: limit access by matching MAC address. easily defeated.
  - **Antenna placement**: focus coverage on needed areas. limit access outside building. adjust power levels.
  - **Power levels**: Power levels and channel selection should be tuned:
    - access points do not interfere with one another.
    - broadcast a signal that client can "hear" but cannot reply to.
  - **Wireless client isolation**: clients can only communicate via its gateway. peer-to-peer blocked.
  - **Guest network isolation**: on a separate network. custom security policy. internet only access(not local network).
  - **Preshared keys (PSKs)**: cryptographic symmetric key that is shared in advance between two or more parties to enable secure communication.

  - **Captive portal**: guest network. perform authentication by redirecting stations to a secure web page.
- **IoT access considerations**:
  - regular audit:
    - prevent shadow IT(uncontrolled deployment of smart devices).
    - supplier security policies and procedures.
  - administrative interface is secured(no default passwords) and devices are assigned proper organizational roles.
  - update patches. isolate network(vlan or guest).

  - **Clientless VPN**: HTML5 has cryptography API. connect to vpn tunnel without separate application.
  - **Split tunnel vs. full tunnel**:
    - full: all traffic goes through tunnel. traffic from client goes to vpn, then sent to internet.
    - split: some data is sent to vpn tunnel.
- **Remote desktop connection**: windows RDP. share desktop remote location. VNC(virtual network computing): open source.
- **Remote desktop gateway**: access to networked apps. connect to virtual desktop or implement clientless vpn.
- **SSH**: terminal screen encrypted on other computer.
- **Virtual network computing (VNC)**: alternative to RDP(windows). share desktop(remote access). many OS's.

  - restrict access to defined users or groups.
  - restrict access to defined time of day.
  - restrict privileges to part of the network.
  - logging and auditing: logons, attempted logons.
  - latest update/patches.
- **In-band vs. out-of-band management**:
  - in-band: management traffic on the "production" network. VLAN to isolate management traffic.
  - out-of-band: dedicated port(console.port). management access is on separate network. more secure.

    - electromagetic interference (EMI): electromagnetic source not part of signal(noise). microwave, other wifi on same channel, bluetooth, cordless phone.
  - **Decibel (dB) loss**: one-tenth of a bel. signal strength(power|magnitude of an electric field). closer to 0 better. -65dBm good signal. -80dBm packet loss.
    - dB loss: poor signal, CRC errors, data corruption. EMI(electromagnetic interference).
    - cable: proper distance. no metal staples. bend radius.
    - wifi: spectrum analyzer to find sources of noise, attenuation and signal strength.
  - **Incorrect pinout**: conductors are incorrectly wired into the terminals. pinout circuit tester.

  - **Duplexing issues**:
    - speed: 10/100/1000/auto; less than expected throughput.
    - duplex: half/full/auto; late collision counter increase.
  - **Transmit and receive (TX/RX) reversed**: incorrect connector install or crossover cable.
    - test with ethernet cable tester. Auto-MDI-X will auto correct. no connectivity.

- **Specifications and limitations**
  - Throughput
  - Speed

  - Client disassociation issues

%

- **Specifications and limitations**
  - **Throughput**: amount of data successfully transfered over time.
  - **Speed**: maximum bandwidth
  - **Distance**:
    - cable:
    - wifi: strength of signal -65dBm(good), -80dBm(bad)
  - **Received signal strength indication (RSSI) signal strength**: radio signal. dBm. decibel-milliwatt. spectrum analyzer.
  - **Effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP)/power settings**: signal strength.
    - transmit strength + antenna gain - cable loss.
    - 2.4GHz max EIRP +36dBm(4W).
- **Considerations**:
  - **Antennas**
    - **Placement**: higher(better). no signal obstruction.
    - **Type**:
      - omni-directional(like bubble, radiates out).
      - focused signal: yagi, parabolic(greater gain).
    - **Polarization**: orientation relative to surface of earth(flat, vertical). both(transmit,receive) need same polarization.
  - **Channel utilization**: multiple AP in range of each other on same wavelength can cause problems.
  - **AP association time**: access points are configured with different channels so that where BSAs overlap, there is no interference.
  - **Site survey**: look at blueprints. see what would cause interference. AP needs ethernet port and power. wifi analyzer to see all frequencies in area.
    - heap map: software on laptop. walk around building and map signal strength with laptop.
- **Common issues**
  - **Interference**: wired: emi interference, sharp bends. wifi: obstruction of signal. walls, glass, water.
    - **Channel overlap**: channel 1,6,11 give you 25MHz bandwidth each channel. 2.4GHz has 90MHz total bandwidth.
  - **Antenna cable attenuation/signal loss**: further from destination, weaker signal. attenuation. dBm.
    - can increase power to send signal further, but client device may not have enough power to send signal back.
    - signal loss can happen in the coax connected to antenna.
  - **RF attenuation/signal loss**: antenna placement: to low, far away. cable to antenna loss.
  - **Wrong SSID**: service set identifier. security concern because no-login connections means everything is in the open.
  - **Incorrect passphrase**: psk(everyone uses same password). enterprise everyone has separate pw. 802.1X has to be trouble-shooted for problems. check communication.
    - legacy device cannot connect to modern enterprise hardware.
  - **Encryption protocol mismatch**: connection will fail. driver update or OS patch may be required.
  - **Insufficient wireless coverage**: place AP at edge and different channels where they overlap.
  - **Captive portal issues**: sent from AP. login/welcome screen.
  - **Client disassociation issues**: DoS attack. deauth attack. sending disassociation frames. wireshark can find them. remove device causing problem or upgrade to 802.11 standard.

## 5.5 Given a scenario, troubleshoot general networking issues

- **Considerations**
  - Device configuration review
  - Routing tables
  - Interface status
  - VLAN assignment
  - Network performance baselines
- **Common issues**
  - Collisions
  - Broadcast storm
  - Duplicate MAC address
  - Duplicate IP address
  - Multicast flooding
  - Asymmetrical routing
  - Switching loops
  - Routing loops
  - Rogue DHCP server
  - DHCP scope exhaustion
  - **IP setting issues**
    - Incorrect gateway
    - Incorrect subnet mask
    - Incorrect IP address
    - Incorrect DNS
  - Missing route
  - Low optical link budget
  - Certificate issues
  - Hardware failure
  - Host-based/network-based firewall settings
  - Blocked services, ports, or addresses
  - Incorrect VLAN
  - DNS issues
  - NTP issues
  - BYOD challenges
  - Licensed feature issues
  - Network performance issues

%

- **Considerations**
  - **Device configuration review**: checking that the running configuration matches the documented baseline.
  - **Routing tables**: make sure routes to network are good. static routes you can easily create loop. make sure default gateway for traffic not matching routing table. `show route`
  - **Interface status**: how interface is configured. speed/duplex mismatch `show interface f0/0`
    - what errors do you see?
      - cyclic redundancy check erros (CRC): mismatch CRC is a frame data coruption error. cause: interference.
      - encapsulation errors: cause: ethernet header type mismatch, ethernet trunk mismatch, WAN framing mismatch.
      - runt frames: size smaller than 64 bytes. cause: collison. duplex mismatch.
      - giant frames: larger than 1518 bytes. cause: 802.1q trunk(add 802.1Q label to header making frame larger than 1518 bytes) or frame size is set to use jumbo frames.
  - **VLAN assignment**: incorrect vlan configuration will not be able to communicate on network. access vlan or trunk vlan. make sure port your plugged into is on the correct vlan.
  - **Network performance baselines**: compare for spikes in traffic. troubleshooting problems. collection of data you can view in GUI.
- **Common issues**
  - **Collisions**: half-duplex problems with collision. full-duplex(no collisions). bad interface hardware.
  - **Broadcast storm**: on same network. to many broadcast can cause performance problems. separate network into small subnets(broadcast domains).
  - **Duplicate MAC address**: burned-in address. on-path attack is a duplicate MAC address. It's rare manufacture create device with duplicate MAC. Take packet capture, should see ARP contention(same MAC, IP keeps changing)
  - **Duplicate IP address**: more common. cause intermittent connectivity. OS detect it, will disable itself. ping network to make sure IP is not in use. If get a response, look at ARP table to see MAC address of device.
  - **Multicast flooding**: one-to-many. switches forward multicast out every port. routers do not. only those that subscribe to multicast address will read packet.
    - IGMP snooping: Internet Group Management Protocol. inteligent descisions about who is subscribed to multicast address. only floods those ports.
  - **Asymmetrical routing**: retrun path(packet) is different from forward path.
    - load balancers or multiple redundant routers/switches. return path has higher latency than forward path.
    - firewalls may drop sessions, if packet left from one firewall and is sent back through different firewall.
    - traceroute to compare per-hop latency.
  - **Switching loops**: solved by Spanning Tree Protocol. traffic gets stuck in a loop between switches. There is no TTL on frames.
  - **Routing loops**: misconfigured routers think each other is best path. packet goes back and forth to each router like a ping pong.
    - traceroute.
  - **Rogue DHCP server**: clients can be assigned duplicate IP(connectivity issues). enable DHCP snooping. authorize DHCP in Active Directory. enable Port Security.
    - Disable rogue DHCP, renew IP addresses.
  - **DHCP scope exhaustion**: depleted IP pool addresses. check DHCP server.
    - IPAM(IP address management): monitor and report IP shortages.
    - lower lease time to have more available IP address on network.
  - **IP setting issues**:
    - check device settings: IP address, subnet mask, gateway, dns. Monitor traffic.
    - Not sure what the settings should be: check other devices on network.
    - `ipconfig /all`, // check DHCP setting on machine to verify:
      - **Incorrect gateway**
      - **Incorrect subnet mask**
      - **Incorrect IP address**
      - **Incorrect DNS**
  - **Missing route**: no destination in routing table, router will discard packet.
    - ICMP host unreachable will show up.
    - ping: check for connectivity. make sure correct routes for both ingress/egress traffic.
  - **Low optical link budget**: block light, no traffic can flow.
    - Attenuation: drop in signal over long distance, dirty connection.
    - check with light meter.
  - **Certificate issues**: something wrong with cert. domain name, expired, signed by recognized authority.
    - on-path attack, problem with server, problem with cert.
  - **Hardware failure**: no response, device could be bad. check lights. power?
  - **Host-based/network-based firewall settings**: filter good traffic. packet capture.
  - **Blocked services, ports, or addresses**: traceroute, packet capture, ping.
  - **Incorrect VLAN**: check settings. wrong vlan port assignment on switch.
  - **DNS issues**: web browser not working. ping works, but can't browse. can reach by ip but not domain name.
    - check dns ip configuration.
    - nslookup, dig.
  - **NTP issues**: kerbos uses timestamps to invalidate old tickets are. if timestamp wrong, client will not be able to login with correct credentials.
  - **BYOD challenges**: employees own device. difficult to secure.
    - MDM sets policy about what can and cannot be used on device.
  - **Licensed feature issues**: pay for license, you can use feature.
    - When working on lab device, if your features are enabled but in production there not, your settings will fail when you roll out changes to all devices.
  - **Network performance issues**:
    - I/O bus, CPU speed, storage access speed, network throughput.
    - monitor all metrics to find where slow down is occuring.
